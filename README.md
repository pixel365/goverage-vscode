# Goverage – Inline Go Code Coverage Hints for VS Code

**Goverage** is a VS Code extension that displays inline code coverage hints for Go files, based on the `go test -coverprofile` report.  
It helps visualize how well your Go functions and files are covered by tests.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **File-level coverage**: shown above the `package` line.
- ✅ **Function-level coverage**: shown above each `func` declaration.
- ✅ Parses `coverage.out` generated by `go test -coverpkg=./... -coverprofile=coverage.out`.
- ✅ Updates automatically when `coverage.out` is saved or opened.
- ✅ Supports both unit and integration tests.

## 🛠️ Notes

- Coverage uses Go’s [`coverprofile`](https://go.dev/blog/cover) format.
- Calculations are based on **statements covered**, not lines.
- The extension reads the `go.mod` file to resolve the module name for path matching.
- Monorepo support assumes `coverage.out` and `go test` are run per-module.
- Integration tests may not mark functions as covered unless directly invoked.
